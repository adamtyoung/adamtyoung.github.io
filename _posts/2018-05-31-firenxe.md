We returned the rental cars to Florence and hiked with our luggage across the Arno to our apartment one block from the famous David status in Piazza della Signoria. The five flights of stairs up to our place was exhausting but afforded us a great view of the busy street and across to the Duomo roof. We spent our time in Firenze eating prosciutto panini, mountains of gelato, and visiting the many beautiful _chiesa_ , the Boboli Gardens, and the incredible Uffizi Gallery.
