So sorry for the long delay! Turns out travelling to amazing new places with family is not conducive to sitting down and blogging! I'll try to wrap up the amazing final week in Rome. 

After a scenic train ride through Tuscany we arrived at Termini Station in the heat. A friendly Roman shouted 'Welcome to Rome' as he left a small grocery store and saw us wheeling our way to our apartment on Via Merulana near the massive Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, in the Monti neighbourhood. We settled in to our cool digs and ate some delicious pizza at nearby Zizzi Pizza. During our week in Rome, we stood curbside for the final stage of the [Giro d'Italia](http://www.giroditalia.it/eng/stage/stage-21-2018/), marvelled at the beauty of the Pantheon, the Forum and Colosseum, Bernini's incredible sculptures in the Gallery Borghese, and the paintings at the [Doria Pamphili](http://www.doriapamphilj.it/roma/en/). We drank many spritzes and negronis, consumed three _gelati_ per person per day, and ate breakfast at Caffe Regoli every morning.

Totally loved Rome, and will return! Thanks for tuning in and sorry for the delays!
