We are embarking on a three-week journey through Northern Italy next week. Our itinerary will see us land in Venice for a few days, spend a week in an Umbrian monastery (_ex_-monastery), visit Florence for a couple of days, and finally enjoy Rome for a week. There will be seven of us travelling; this blog will post random details, photos, and snippets that I learn while travelling through Italy. Stay tuned.
