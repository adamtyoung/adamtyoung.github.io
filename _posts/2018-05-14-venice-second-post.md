We wandered south from Cannaregio, across the _Ponti degli Scalzi_, and checked out the cool bookstore [Acqua Alta][1]. Unfortunately, the nice weather, Sunday-ness, and high-noon combined to make Piazza San Marco unbearably busy, and, incredible as the Basilica, the Campanile, and the Palazzo are, we booked it out of there stat, crossing the Rialto on our way to a great standing lunch at [Sepa][2]. The afternoon was dispensed with drawing on the Grand Canal and drinking Negronis at the little bars of Santa Croce. We ate _a la casa_ and then hailed a water taxi to take us to a performance of the Barber of Seville, part of the [Musica a Palazzo program][3]. Another water taxi back to the apartment where the jet lag finally brought me crashing down.
