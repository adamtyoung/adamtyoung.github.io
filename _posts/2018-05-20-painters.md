Today (the 14th of May) finds us exploring Venice’s painting riches in their natural habitat,  the *chiesas*. The unassuming church behind our apartment houses some wonderful work (*San Giobbe*) but was unfortunately closed for renovation. We continued on, then, to the home and final resting place of Tintoretto at *Madonna del’Orto*.  His incredible tall paintings in the nave of the beautiful Gothic brick church were stunning. Cima are also well represented. Bolstered by the majestic power of Tintoretto’s compositions, we wandered through the charming *fondamente* of this neighbourhood, winding our way to *Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari*. Titian’s *Pesaro Madonna* and *Assumption* were some highlights, as well as Donatello’s *St John the Baptist*. The church itself is incredible. Next was the stunning San Rocco, every inch decorated, dozens of paintings by Tintoretto. The rest of the day was dispensed with the cafés and osteria of Santa Margherita, lingering in the sun.
