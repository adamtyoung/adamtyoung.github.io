After a great stay in Venice, we took the train to Florence, rented cars, and set off to our Umbrian monastery. Heavy rain pounded us as we turned off at Valfabbrica and stocked up on groceries and meat in the small town. The dirt road was rough with some large washouts, but as we pulled in to literal paradise the sun came out over the large monastery and pool that was to be our home for the next week. 

It is hard to describe the beauty of this place, the incredible green hilly setting, or the totally relaxing vibe of the pool. Morning runs through the mountains, swimming constantly, cooking in the amazing kitchen, and day trips to the towns of Umbria (Assisi, Perugia, Gubbio). Other highlights of our week include: a day spent with Mac and Francescaâ€™s family near the tiny town of Pettino truffle hunting and enjoying a big meal with their family; a morning spent riding horses through the idyllic mountains, and a chef that came to cook a four-course meal for us at the monastery.
