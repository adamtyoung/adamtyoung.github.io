A long day in the air, uneventful, draining, but _siamo qui, finalamente_. Venice  hot and sunny as we pulled up to the Guglie bridge stop in our _vaporetto_. Giovanni, our host, greeted us in broken English and installed us in our charming digs, in Cannaregio. A day of exploring the neighbourhood, eating well at the small canal restaurants, gelato. A lovely city, overwhelmingly beautiful. Early run this morning, coffee at a bar, and now riling the crew to head out and explore along the Grand Canal.
